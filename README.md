# Introduction 
This program computes some basic statistics on a collection of small positive integers between 0 and 1000 giving the amount of numbers lower, greater and between than a given specific values 

# Getting Started
- Please use Python 3.8 or later
- No additional packages are required

# Build and Test
1. Run ```python3 main.py``` in root folder (default example computes for the list [3, 9, 3, 4, 6] numbers lower than 4, numbers between 3 and 6 and numbers greater than 4), the output would be a tuple giving (lower, between, greater)
2. For running the tests run ```pytest -v``` in root folder (it will check 7 test cases)

# Contribute
Please fell free of running a desired test cases modyfing line 61 to 65 of main.py script
